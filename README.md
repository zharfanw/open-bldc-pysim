Open-BLDC-pysim is a brushless motor and inverter simulation written in python using
numpy. It's goal is to test the underlying mathematics of brushless motor
simulation, to be used later in a C reimplementation directly in Open-BLDC
running against the actual Open-BLDC control code.

Implementation
==============
Current implementation is based on the "Switching Pattern-Independent
Simulation Model for Brushless DC Motors" paper by Yongjin Kang and Ji-Yoon Yoo
(http://www.jpe.or.kr/On_line/admin/paper/files/8_JPE-10238.pdf). Some other
papers were consulted during implementation but the above paper is the main
reference.

Reference
=========
The implementation is crosschecked against the output of the free version of
PSIM (http://www.powersimtech.com/index.php?name=psim)

Dependencies
============
numpy
scipy
python 2.6

How to run
==========
$ ./sim_1.py
